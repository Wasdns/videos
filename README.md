# The collection of the state-of-the-art SDN/NFV talks (SIGCOMM/NSDI videos). 

This repository maintains the state-of-the-art SDN/NFV talks including SIGCOMM/NSDI videos. I do not want to collect all the paper talks in this repository. Instead, I simply want to record some interesting talks that inspired me with new visions or ideas. You can also find them in the official websites of these conferences.
